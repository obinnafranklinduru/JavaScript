#   To Shuffle an Array

Shuffle - rearrange (a pack of cards) by sliding them over each other quickly.

1. Define the array

2. Create a function and passed in the array as parameter

3. Create a variable to store the length of the array

4. Create a loop that will check if the length of the array is not equal to zero or one. 
    Reason: When the array is equal to zero or one, there won't be need to shuffle
    Qustion: Can you shuffle a card?

5. Inside the loop, create a variable to store a random number. 
    Reason: This random number will be used as our index later while we are shuffling

6. Decrease the length of the array by one.
    Reason: to get the last value of the array

7. Now the swap begins:
    Swap the index of the last value with the random index of the array and via versa
    
8. Return the array.
