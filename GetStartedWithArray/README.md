Get Started with JavaScript Arrays

An array is an ordered list of values. Each value is called an element and is specified by an index.

Let's do some examples with the following:

push() - To add from the end of an array

pop() - To remove from the end of an array

shift() -  To remove from the front of an array

unshift() - To add from the front of an array

splice() - To insert or delete elements from any part of the array.
